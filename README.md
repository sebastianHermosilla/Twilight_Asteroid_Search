# Twilight_Asteroid_Search

This pipeline is designed to search for asteroids during twilight periods. It automates the creation of all necessary documents required to use the software findPOTATOs to identify moving sources. Additionally, the pipeline will characterize all your findings, providing the necessary information to determine whether a detection is a false positive or a potential new asteroid discovery.
